API Used:  
OpenWeather - Made a temporary arrangement for the API key.  
  
Approach:  
Task1.py uses the "OpenWeather" API to update the weather data required for 5 different cities into a temporary excel
worksheet, Meanwhile.xlsm. This temporary file is connected to another excel file, WeatherData.xlsx, which is used to 
see the refreshed data live. Because an excel file cannot be opened and written to at the same time.
